This repository provides a case study of my contributions to the development of a centralised HVAC control system built in collaboration with Panasonic. The project aimed to create a scalable web interface for controlling and monitoring air conditioning units in commercial buildings.

---

## Project Objective

The goal was to develop a centralised system to:
- Control indoor/outdoor HVAC units remotely
- Visualise energy consumption and usage patterns
- Simulate physical behavior of units via a custom simulator
- Support future AI integration for automated climate control

---

## My Role: UI & Data Visualisation Lead

I was responsible for:

### User Interface Development
- Designed and built a responsive web dashboard for centralised HVAC control
- Created **interactive widgets** for toggling unit states, adjusting settings, and viewing status in real-time
- Integrated a **3D floor plan view** for spatial awareness of unit locations

### Data Visualisation
- Implemented a dynamic **heat-map overlay** to display energy usage trends
- Used charting libraries to visualise unit performance and efficiency

### AI-Ready Design
- Structured UI components and data flow for future integration with an AI control module
- Contributed to writing the **manual/spec** for AI system integration points

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Svelte.js, Three.js (for 3D view)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express (partial support for simulator API)
- **Other**: Figma (UI design), Git, Docker (simulator), WebSocket (real-time data)

---

## Collaboration

This project was developed under the supervision of academic advisors and Panasonic engineers. Requirements and system specs evolved through regular feedback sessions and client reviews.

---

## Note

Due to the nature of this collaboration, source code and project assets cannot be made public. This case study highlights my contribution and technical approach.

---

## What I Learned

- Building scalable web interfaces for hardware simulation/control
- Visualising real-time sensor data in an intuitive way
- Working within constraints of real-world client expectations and timelines
- Preparing systems for downstream AI integration
